Goal
* Want to get married and divorce counts

Todo
* we want to take this and get counts of 1) # of marriages, 2) whether each lasted 3) how long each lasted 
    
why is second event broken

Done
* grab the info boxes

backlog
process the spouses, then the spouse, then the spouse(s) column
Will need to pull the 1000 actors list or find a new one

To Note
'\u200b' gpt wasn't great about the parsing. The whole thing of trying to use it to parse semi messy things, it wasn't as good as me trying myself. But couldn't know that til we tried it

Future
grab the personal life section and use LLMs over it
